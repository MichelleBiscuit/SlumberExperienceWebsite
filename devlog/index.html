                    I know I said I was going to 'work on levels from here on out' but i sorely needed a break from development.
                    So, I've been working on a website! Well you already know this because you're on it right now hehe.
                    I took my time and it was very fun to work with html and css again, hope yall will enjoy it!
                    Also, I'm going to add something to the main menu of the game to show this website's devlog so you can see when updates are out in game.

                    Took a little break for thanksgiving, but before that I reworked on the code A LOT.<br>
                    I redone the player, door,  saving, loading, and the collectible's code to use better and faster functions for smoother gameplay.<br>
                    I also added Discord RPC support as well as changed the post processing effect to be more pixel-y and to use less colors, also some other bug fixes and small stuff I didn't mention.<br>
                    I'll be working on the levels from here on out!

                    I've been hard at work since I first made this page to bring you an okay sized update!
                    The game now has, collectibles, a few secrets,
                    saving and loading (including player position and cam rotation), a slightly expanded map, and a nice new title screen!
